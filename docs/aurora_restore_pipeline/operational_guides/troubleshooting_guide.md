# Aurora Restore Pipeline Troubleshooting Guide

This document provides detailed instructions for troubleshooting the Aurora Restore Pipeline.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Step Functions Execution Failures

#### Issue: Step Functions execution fails with an error message.

**Solution:**

1. Check the Step Functions execution history to identify the failed state and the error message.
2. Review the CloudWatch Logs for the Lambda function associated with the failed state.
3. Check the DynamoDB tables for any error messages or state information.
4. Verify that the input parameters for the Step Functions execution are correct.
5. Ensure that the IAM roles and policies are correctly configured.
6. Check the VPC configuration and ensure that the Lambda functions have the necessary network access.

### Lambda Function Errors

#### Issue: Lambda function fails with an error message.

**Solution:**

1. Review the CloudWatch Logs for the Lambda function to identify the error message.
2. Check the input parameters for the Lambda function.
3. Verify that the Lambda function has the necessary permissions to access the required AWS resources.
4. Ensure that the Lambda function is correctly configured with the appropriate environment variables, VPC settings, and IAM role.
5. Check the Lambda function code for any logical errors or issues.

### DynamoDB Table Issues

#### Issue: DynamoDB table operations fail with an error message.

**Solution:**

1. Review the CloudWatch Logs for the Lambda function that is interacting with the DynamoDB table.
2. Check the IAM role and policies to ensure that the Lambda function has the necessary permissions to access the DynamoDB table.
3. Verify that the DynamoDB table name and structure are correct.
4. Ensure that the DynamoDB table is in the same region as the Lambda function.

### SNS Topic Issues

#### Issue: SNS topic operations fail with an error message.

**Solution:**

1. Review the CloudWatch Logs for the Lambda function that is interacting with the SNS topic.
2. Check the IAM role and policies to ensure that the Lambda function has the necessary permissions to access the SNS topic.
3. Verify that the SNS topic name and ARN are correct.
4. Ensure that the SNS topic is in the same region as the Lambda function.

### KMS Key Issues

#### Issue: KMS key operations fail with an error message.

**Solution:**

1. Review the CloudWatch Logs for the Lambda function that is interacting with the KMS key.
2. Check the IAM role and policies to ensure that the Lambda function has the necessary permissions to access the KMS key.
3. Verify that the KMS key ID and ARN are correct.
4. Ensure that the KMS key is in the same region as the Lambda function.

### VPC Configuration Issues

#### Issue: Lambda functions fail to access resources in the VPC.

**Solution:**

1. Review the VPC configuration and ensure that the Lambda functions are deployed in the correct subnets.
2. Check the security group settings and ensure that the Lambda functions have the necessary inbound and outbound rules.
3. Verify that the Lambda functions have access to the NAT Gateway or VPC Endpoints for accessing AWS services.
4. Ensure that the VPC has the necessary DNS settings and DHCP options.

### RDS Cluster Issues

#### Issue: RDS cluster operations fail with an error message.

**Solution:**

1. Review the CloudWatch Logs for the Lambda function that is interacting with the RDS cluster.
2. Check the IAM role and policies to ensure that the Lambda function has the necessary permissions to access the RDS cluster.
3. Verify that the RDS cluster name, ARN, and other parameters are correct.
4. Ensure that the RDS cluster is in the same region as the Lambda function.
5. Check the RDS cluster status and ensure that it is available and not in a failed state.

### Snapshot Issues

#### Issue: Snapshot operations fail with an error message.

**Solution:**

1. Review the CloudWatch Logs for the Lambda function that is interacting with the snapshot.
2. Check the IAM role and policies to ensure that the Lambda function has the necessary permissions to access the snapshot.
3. Verify that the snapshot ID and other parameters are correct.
4. Ensure that the snapshot is in the same region as the Lambda function.
5. Check the snapshot status and ensure that it is available and not in a failed state.

## Debugging Steps

If you encounter an issue that is not covered in the Common Issues and Solutions section, follow these debugging steps:

1. **Review the CloudWatch Logs**: Check the CloudWatch Logs for the relevant Lambda functions and Step Functions executions to identify the error message and the context in which it occurred.

2. **Check the DynamoDB Tables**: Review the State Table and Audit Table for any error messages or state information that may provide insights into the issue.

3. **Verify the Input Parameters**: Ensure that the input parameters for the Step Functions execution and Lambda functions are correct and match the expected format.

4. **Check the IAM Roles and Policies**: Verify that the IAM roles and policies are correctly configured and that the Lambda functions have the necessary permissions to access the required AWS resources.

5. **Review the VPC Configuration**: Ensure that the VPC configuration is correct and that the Lambda functions have the necessary network access to interact with the required AWS services.

6. **Check the AWS Service Status**: Verify that the AWS services used by the pipeline (e.g., Step Functions, Lambda, DynamoDB, SNS, KMS, RDS) are operational and not experiencing any issues.

7. **Consult the AWS Documentation**: Refer to the AWS documentation for the relevant services to understand the expected behavior and any known issues or limitations.

8. **Contact AWS Support**: If the issue persists and you have exhausted all other troubleshooting steps, consider contacting AWS Support for assistance.
