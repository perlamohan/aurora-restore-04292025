# Architectural Overview

This document provides a high-level architectural overview of the Aurora Restore Pipeline.

## System Architecture

The Aurora Restore Pipeline is built using a serverless architecture on AWS, leveraging several managed services to provide a reliable, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automating Aurora database restores.

### Core Components

The pipeline consists of the following core components:

1. **AWS Lambda**: Serverless functions that handle specific tasks in the pipeline, such as:
   - Snapshot validation
   - Snapshot copying
   - Cluster deletion
   - Cluster restoration
   - Database user setup
   - Notifications

2. **AWS Step Functions**: State machine that orchestrates the execution of Lambda functions in a specific sequence, handling retries, error handling, and state transitions.

3. **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database used for:
   - State management: Tracking the state of each restore operation
   - Audit logging: Recording all operations for compliance and troubleshooting

4. **Amazon SNS**: Notification service for alerting stakeholders about the status of restore operations.

5. **AWS Secrets Manager**: Secure storage for sensitive information, such as:
   - Database credentials
   - KMS keys
   - API tokens

6. **Amazon RDS/Aurora**: The database service being managed by the pipeline.

7. **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging service for:
   - Lambda function logs
   - Metrics collection
   - Alarms
   - Dashboards

8. **AWS IAM**: Identity and access management for securing access to AWS resources.

## Data Flow

The data flow through the Aurora Restore Pipeline follows this sequence:

1. **Snapshot Check**: Validates that the source snapshot exists and is available.
2. **Copy Snapshot** (if needed): Copies the snapshot to the target region if the source and target regions are different.
3. **Check Copy Status**: Monitors the snapshot copy operation until it completes.
4. **Delete RDS** (if requested): Deletes an existing Aurora cluster with the same name if it exists.
5. **Check Delete Status**: Monitors the cluster deletion operation until it completes.
6. **Restore Snapshot**: Creates a new Aurora cluster from the snapshot.
7. **Check Restore Status**: Monitors the cluster restore operation until it completes.
8. **Setup DB Users**: Configures database users and permissions.
9. **Archive Snapshot**: Handles snapshot cleanup after a successful restore.
10. **Send Notification**: Notifies stakeholders about the status of the restore operation.

## State Management

The Aurora Restore Pipeline uses DynamoDB for state management. Each restore operation has a unique `operation_id` that is used to track its progress through the pipeline. The state is updated at each step of the pipeline, with information such as:

- Current step
- Timestamp
- Success/failure status
- Error messages
- Resource identifiers (snapshot ID, cluster ID, etc.)

This state management approach enables:
- Resumability: Operations can be resumed if interrupted
- Auditability: All operations are logged for compliance and troubleshooting
- Visibility: Current status can be queried at any time

## Security Considerations

The Aurora Restore Pipeline incorporates several security measures:

1. **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted, including:
   - Snapshots (using KMS)
   - Secrets (using Secrets Manager)
   - State data (using DynamoDB encryption)

2. **Least Privilege**: IAM roles are configured with the minimum permissions needed for each component.

3. **Network Security**: VPC configurations ensure that resources are not exposed to the public internet.

4. **Audit Logging**: All operations are logged for compliance and security auditing.

## Scalability and Performance

The serverless architecture of the Aurora Restore Pipeline enables it to scale automatically based on demand. Key considerations include:

1. **Lambda Concurrency**: Lambda functions can execute concurrently, enabling multiple restore operations to run in parallel.

2. **DynamoDB Throughput**: DynamoDB tables are provisioned with sufficient capacity to handle the expected load.

3. **Step Functions Capacity**: Step Functions can manage thousands of concurrent state machine executions.

4. **Asynchronous Operations**: Long-running operations (like snapshot copying and cluster restoration) are monitored asynchronously, allowing the pipeline to handle multiple operations efficiently.

## Error Handling and Resilience

The Aurora Restore Pipeline incorporates robust error handling and resilience features:

1. **Retry Logic**: Step Functions includes built-in retry logic for transient failures.

2. **Error States**: The state machine includes error states that handle specific types of failures.

3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging helps diagnose and troubleshoot issues.

4. **Graceful Degradation**: The pipeline can continue to function even if some components fail.
