# Aurora Restore Pipeline: Best Practices Guide

This document outlines recommended best practices for deploying, maintaining, and using the Aurora Restore Pipeline efficiently and securely.

## Deployment Best Practices

### Resource Naming
- Use consistent naming conventions with prefixes like `aurora-restore-` for all resources
- Include environment indicators in resource names (e.g., `-dev`, `-prod`)

### Infrastructure as Code
- Maintain all CloudFormation templates in version control
- Document all parameter values and their justifications
- Use parameter validation constraints in templates

### Environment Isolation
- Deploy separate stacks for development, testing, and production
- Use different AWS accounts for production and non-production environments
- Maintain consistent configuration across environments with parameterized templates

## Security Best Practices

### IAM Permissions
- Follow least privilege principle for all IAM roles
- Regularly review and audit IAM permissions
- Use IAM Access Analyzer to identify unused permissions

### Secret Management
- Rotate database credentials regularly using Secrets Manager
- Restrict access to secrets with IAM conditions
- Audit secret access using CloudTrail

### Encryption
- Enable encryption at rest for all components:
  - DynamoDB tables
  - S3 buckets
  - RDS snapshots and clusters
  - CloudWatch Logs
- Use KMS Customer Managed Keys (CMK) for critical data

### Network Security
- Deploy Lambda functions in VPCs when access to private resources is required
- Use Security Groups to restrict network access
- Implement VPC endpoints for AWS services to avoid data traversing the public internet

## Operational Best Practices

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Set up alerts for Lambda function failures
- Monitor Step Function execution failures
- Track critical metrics like restoration time and success rate
- Create custom dashboards for operational visibility

### Logging
- Implement structured logging with consistent JSON format
- Include correlation IDs in all logs
- Set appropriate log retention periods
- Centralize logs for analysis

### State Management
- Never delete operational state during active restorations
- Implement state cleanup procedures for completed operations
- Regularly backup state in DynamoDB

### Error Handling
- Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Design Step Functions to handle errors gracefully
- Document common error scenarios and resolution steps

## Database Restore Best Practices

### Scheduling
- Schedule routine restores during off-peak hours
- Implement maintenance windows for production environments
- Coordinate with database users before initiating restores

### Testing
- Validate restored databases before exposing to applications
- Run automated tests against restored databases
- Verify database user access and permissions

### Capacity Planning
- Choose appropriate DB instance classes for restore targets
- Monitor storage capacity and adjust as needed
- Consider cost implications of multi-region snapshots

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Cleanup
- Delete temporary resources after successful restores
- Implement automatic cleanup for failed operations
- Set lifecycle policies for snapshot deletion

### Right-sizing
- Use appropriate Lambda memory configurations
- Scale DynamoDB capacity based on workload
- Choose cost-effective RDS instance types

### Monitoring Costs
- Tag all resources for cost allocation
- Set up AWS Budgets for cost monitoring
- Review AWS Cost Explorer reports regularly

## Custom Configuration Best Practices

### Parameter Management
- Store environment-specific parameters in Parameter Store
- Document all configurable parameters
- Implement validation for custom parameters

### Extensibility
- Follow modular design principles when extending functionality
- Test customizations thoroughly before deployment
- Document all custom configurations

## Disaster Recovery Planning

### Backup Strategy
- Maintain copies of critical snapshots in multiple regions
- Document snapshot retention policies
- Test snapshot restoration process regularly

### Recovery Procedures
- Document step-by-step recovery procedures
- Establish RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
- Train operations team on recovery procedures

## Compliance and Governance

### Audit Trails
- Enable AWS CloudTrail for all API activities
- Implement application-level audit logging
- Retain audit logs according to compliance requirements

### Documentation
- Maintain up-to-date architecture diagrams
- Document all operational procedures
- Record configuration changes and approvals
